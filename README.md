# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Neural-Network-on-MNIST-Dataset
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset — a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28x28 pixels.
